# python
What does this code do?
This Python code demonstrates the use of a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a given integer. It defines a function factorial that takes an integer n and returns the product of n and the factorial of n-1 (which is calculated by calling the factorial function recursively). The base case of the recursion is when n equals 1, in which case the function simply returns 1. The code then calls the factorial function with the argument 5 and prints the result (which should be 120) to the console.

How do I run this code?
To run this code, you'll need to have Python installed on your computer.

Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where you've saved this code.
Type python main.py and press enter.
The factorial of 5 (which should be 120) should be printed to the console.
